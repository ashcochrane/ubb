#: WHICH QUANTITY A RATE PRICES WHEN THE FIXTURE NEVER SAID (#326).
#:
#: Most callers here name one; the ones that do not are asking for "a rate" and
#: are about something else entirely — an effective moment, a book, a slot. They
#: used to get the empty string, which is not a name any event carries, so their
#: rate matched nothing and that was invisible and harmless. It is no longer
#: writable: a rate names a DECLARED quantity and "" is not one. This is the
#: same nothing, said out loud — a real declaration, under a name no event in
#: this repository measures, so those fixtures keep resolving exactly as they
#: did rather than quietly starting to match a posting.

    than transcribing a two-record setup, and it is why the reference conversion
