"""
Frozen dataclass contracts for outbox events.

Rules:
- All event schemas are frozen dataclasses.
- New fields MUST have defaults (additive-only evolution).
- Breaking changes (renames, removals, type changes) require a new class.
- Producers: construct dataclass -> asdict() -> write to outbox.
- Consumers: filter unknown keys -> construct dataclass from payload.
